1. Declare constants for MongoDB connection
2. This code uses the MongoDB Node.js driver to connect to a MongoDB Atlas cluster using the Stable API version 1 
3. This is a persistent connection to the database, allowing for operations to be performed without needing to reconnect each time.
4. The connection string is stored in an environment variable for security.
5. The database variable is declared but not initialized, allowing it to be set later when needed.
6. The run function is commented out, but it can be used to test the connection by pinging the database.
7. The client will close after the operation is complete, ensuring resources are freed.
